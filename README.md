# DRF API code repository for Dinosaur Games Library

## Concept

My local boardgames group meet each week with members bringing along their own games to share with the group. This can lead to sometimes a limited selection of games on offer, or not knowing which games other members have that the group would like to play. The Dinosaur Games Library app provides a solution to this by allowing members of the group to list the games that they own and are happy to share in an online library available for other members to view and search. Requests could then be made ahead of social events for particular games that the group would like to play to be brought along that week. Additional features of the app would allow admin users to advertise the group to visitors to the site and publicise social events to gain a wider membership, add important group updates to the front page as these can sometimes be missed in the Facebook group, and allow for an 'add to social' button for games to be automatically requested via the app at a particular social event.

## Scope

This repository will hold the data and user accounts for the project and provide API endpoints allowing a front end application to connect to this data in a user friendly manner. The endpoints provided by this API are intended to be connected to programatically by a front end application and not directly accessed by the end user.

## Data Model

The ERD provided here gives an overview of the full project vision, this has been broken down with MoSCoW prioritisation and so will be worked through progressively adding to the functionality as each milestone is achieved.
